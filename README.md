Task Manager App

A simple task management application built with React Native, designed to help users organize their tasks with ease. Users can add tasks with brief descriptions, mark them as complete, and delete tasks once they're no longer needed.

Features:
Add Task: Users can add a new task with a title and brief description.
Mark Task as Complete: Tap on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will appear visually distinct from incomplete ones.
Delete Task: Easily remove a task from the list by pressing the "Delete" button.



App Structure

The app consists of two main components:

App.js: The main entry point, where tasks are added, marked as complete, and deleted.
Task.js: A component that represents individual tasks, with options to visually display completion status.
How to Use the App

Adding a Task:
Enter the task title and description in the input fields at the bottom of the screen.

Marking a Task as Complete:
Tap on any task to mark it as complete. The task will be visually distinguished (you can change the appearance of completed tasks by editing the styles).
